TinyTest is a tiny testing library written in Java. I only write this for myself and I've also never written a library so don't expect it to be complete in any way.
Also, I'll work on this only if I want to, so it can happen that I don't commit anything for several months.
If you want to do proper tests, please use other frameworks
